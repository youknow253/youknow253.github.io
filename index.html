        <h2>CD</h2>
          <p>A CD, or Compact Disc, is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

          <h4>Pros:</h4>
*It won't crash <br/>
*Cover art that you can hold in your hands and enjoy<br>
*Liner notes you can read at your leisure<br>
*Easily visible so easy to find the one you want<br>
*Easily visible so you can showw off your collection<br>
*Higher quality sound (in most cases)<br>
<br>
  <h4> Cons:</h4>
*They can be scratched or broken<br>
*Hard to carry a large collection around<br>
*Not microwaveable friendly

        <h2>Mp3</h2>
      <p>
        The MP3 audio format provides lossy data compression. Audio quality improves with increasing bitrate:</p>
* 32 kbit/s – generally acceptable only for speech<br>
* 96 kbit/s – generally used for speech or low-quality streaming<br>
* 128 or 160 kbit/s – mid-range bitrate quality<br>
* 192 kbit/s – medium quality bitrate<br>
* 256 kbit/s – a commonly used high-quality bitrate<br>
* 320 kbit/s – highest level supported by the MP3 standard<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Pros</h4>

Widespread acceptance, support in nearly all hardware audio players and devices<br>
An ISO standard, part of MPEG specs<br>
Fast decoding, lower complexity than AAC or Vorbis<br>
Anyone can create their own implementation (Specs and demo sources available)<br>
Relaxed licensing schedule<br>

        <h4>Cons</h4>

Lower performance/efficiency than modern codecs.<br>
Problem cases that trip out all transform codecs.<br>
Sometimes, maximum bitrate (320kbps) isn’t enough.<br>
No multichannel implementations.<br>
Unusable for high definition audio (sampling rates higher than 48kHz).
