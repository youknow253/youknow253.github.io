        <h2>Vinyl</h2>
          <p>A gramophone record (phonograph record), commonly known as a vinyl record or simply vinyl or record, is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery (edge) and ends near the center of the disc.</p>
          <article>
            <h3 class="Pgreen">Pros</h3>
              <p>- Itâ€™s a an accurate representation of sound but is limited by the device and recording medium.<br> - Many people find analog sound warmer and more pleasing to the ear.<br> - Distortion caused by over driving the recording with volume saturation can deliver a more pleasing result than digital methods.</p>
            <h3 class="Cred">Cons</h3>
  <p>- Requires large amounts of room to keep all records and cases.<br>- Recordings are susceptible to degradation.<br>
  - Copies of the original recording are noisier and more distorted.<br>
  - Editing is more cumbersome and time consuming.<br>
  - The background noise of the media (tape hiss) and recording device become a part of the recording. </p>

        <h2>Magnetic Tape</h2>
          <p>Magnetic tape is a medium for magnetic recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording.</p>

              <h3>8 Track Tape</h3>
              <p>8-track tape (formally Stereo 8: commonly known as the eight-track cartridge, eight-track tape, or simply eight-track) is a magnetic tape sound recording technology that was popular in the United States[1] from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over.<br> The endless loop tape cartridge was first designed in 1952 by Bernard Cousino around a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard 1/4-inch, plastic, oxide-coated recording tape running at 3.75 in (10 cm) per second. Program starts and stops were signaled by a one-inch-long metal foil that activates the track-change sensor.</p>

              <h3>Cassette Tape</h3>
              <p>The Compact Cassette, also commonly called cassette tape, audio cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is a magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback released by Philips in 1962, developed in Hasselt, Belgium. Compact cassettes come in two forms, either already containing content as a pre-recorded cassette, or as a fully recordable "blank" cassette.</p>

          <h3 class="Pgreen">Pros</h3>
            <p>- They are used for audio books for the blind and have several advantages over other audio media. Cassette tapes come equipped with a label in Braille so that a blind person may read what the tape contains. Cassettes also start from the position where they were stopped enabling a blind person to move the cassette from one player to another without losing his place.<br>- Cassettes are also common in court recordings.</p>
          <h3 class="Cred">Cons</h3>
<p>- Cassette players are more difficult to find than CD or MP3 players in most retail stores.<br>- Finding cassettes is also not as easy as buying CDs or downloading MP3 audio files because many stores no longer carry them or carry a limited selection.<br>- Portable cassette players are bulkier and heavier than MP3 players and cannot hold the quantity of music than digital players can. </p>
